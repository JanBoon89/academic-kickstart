I am a postdoctoral researcher in the research groups Politics & Public Governance (PPG, Departement of Political Sciences) and Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics (CLiPS, Departement of Linguistics) at the University of Antwerp. In 2019, I was awarded a senior postdoc grant from the Flemish Research Council to work on the project “Reputation and Structural Reforms of Public Organizations: Explaining Temporal Dynamics”. In 2021, I received an additional postdoc grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) for my proposal “Breaking the Cycle: On the dynamics between reputation and innovation in government organizations”. I also teach at the Antwerp Management School and University of Antwerp, and previously taught at Tilburg University.
