abstract: Shared Service Centers (SSCs) are popular arrangements for the delivery of support services. However, no-one has systematically analysed how conventional ideas on how to govern SSCs have been introduced in governments. This paper explores the governance of SSCs by juxtaposing agency and stewardship governance prescriptions, and by relating them to empirical examples. More research is needed on the conditions under which different governance methods work.
