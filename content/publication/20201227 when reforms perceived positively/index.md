abstract: The aim of this study is to theorize and test the implicit assumption in the literature that reform perceptions vary according to employees’ position in the organizational hierarchy. Our theoretical argument centres on the expectation that employees appreciate reforms differently depending on their position in the organization. Our large-scale analyses confirm that employees from upper organizational levels are more appreciative of reforms in general, though follow-up analyses on distinct types of reforms demonstrate variations with theoretical and practical implications.
