Why do organizations behave the way they do? This research line builds on the assumption that organizations are to various extents dependent on environmental support for their functioning. Modern organizations are often exposed to inconsistent demands. How do organizations manage such ambiguity? 

My research focuses on the role of reputational motivations as drivers of organizational behavior. Reputation refers to how organizations are perceived by their external stakeholders. I study how organizations (think they) are perceived by their stakeholders, how they want to be perceived, how organizations make sense of inconsistencies, and how this affects their subsequent behaviors. 

I have a particular interest in the temporal dynamics between the reputation of public organizations and the reforms they experience. When the performance of public organizations is perceived to be problematic, political and administrative actors are often urged to initiate structural reforms (e.g., reshuffling tasks between organizations, merging or changing the legal status of organizations). Therefore, reforms have symbolic value as signals to society that problems concerning public sector performance are being perceived and acted upon. However, no studies have examined on a large sample how the perceived performance of public organizations (i.e., their reputation) affects these organizations’ chances for being reformed. Neither do we know how structural reforms in turn impact organizations’ future reputations.
