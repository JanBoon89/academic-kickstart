Organizational behavior scholars study the interface between human behavior and the organization efforts, and the organization itself. Put simply, it studies how  and why organizations (and the individuals and groups within) behave the way they do. 

A critical idea in organizational behavior research is that an adequate understanding of human behavior and motivations should drive (research on) organizational management. In my own research, I study the interface between organizational design (and efforts to re-design) and human behavior (attitudes, emotions and intentions). I am particularly interested in the interaction and tensions between organizational levels. Due to internal differentiation, different (groups of) employees might have a different understanding of the strategic priorities compared to top management. As a result, implementation does often not proceed as planned.
