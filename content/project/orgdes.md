Questions on the optimal design of organizations go to the heart of organization practice and science. Organizations exist to generate collective coordinated action. I study how organizations are designed and coordinated to achieve such coordinated action. Why do organizations organize themselves the way they do, and what are the implications?  

Although changes in organizational design are often applauded by managers and consultants as necessary instruments to improve organizational flexibility, research also shows potentially negative effects of overly intense reform trajectories. I examine why organizations engage in reforms (particularly focusing on the role of reputation), how organizational reforms are managed, and how reforms impact various attitudes and behaviors of employees.
