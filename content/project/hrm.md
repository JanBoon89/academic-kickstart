We spend most of our time work, which testifies to the importance of managing our workplaces in ways that motivate employees and elevate individual and organizational performance. How are, and should, employees be managed? 

My interest in HRM runs through my other research interests. I study (a) how HRM processes are designed and why, (b) how reforms are perceived by employees and how they affect a series of employee attitudes and behaviors, and (c) how the reputation of organizations interferes with employees’ identification processes; that is: how employees deal with conflicts between how they see their organization and the values it should uphold vis-à-vis how society perceives their organization.
